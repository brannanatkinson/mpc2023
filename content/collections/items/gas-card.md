        text: "The cost of gasoline for a vehicle can be unexpectedly expensive especially in town. Your gift will fund gas cards that we're able to share with residents to help them get around town to run errands, attend job interviews, pick up their children from daycare or school, make it to medical or legal appointments, etc."
