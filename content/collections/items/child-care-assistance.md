        text: 'Child care is not only difficult to secure, the expense is also significant. It is the #1 barrier to residents finding and maintaining employment. Your Child Care Assistance gift will support residents seeking meaningful work or maintaining current employment by curbing these child-care costs. Financial stability is essential to long term independence and knowing your children are safely cared for is a fundamental part of this.'
