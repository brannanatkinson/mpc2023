        text: 'The last thing on your mind when fleeing an abusive relationship is what you may need for an interview. Your Interview Essentials gift could provide an interview-ready outfit, hair care or supplies so residents feel confident when applying for jobs. Interview Essentials may also prepare our residents for other situational events like meeting a childâ€™s teacher, attending a graduation, wedding, or funeral. Feeling appropriately dresses in many situations alleviates insecurity.'
