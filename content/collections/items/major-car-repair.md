        text: 'Many residents at The Mary Parrish Center do not arrive with a vehicle, but those that do are almost always in need of major car repairs. Many of the vehicles have been vandalized by abusers or simply deteriorated because of a survivorâ€™s lack of access to finances. Having a safe, reliable vehicle is a tremendous help to a survivor rebuilding his or her life.'
