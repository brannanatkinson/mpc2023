        text: 'Our Transitional Housing program is a cost-free program. We cover the cost of housing and all utilities. Our Rapid Re-housing program is a graduated program where we work with residents to supplement the costs of rent and utilities. Your gift of Rental Assistance provides funding to help The Mary Parrish Center cover the costs of housing for one month for a family of four.'
