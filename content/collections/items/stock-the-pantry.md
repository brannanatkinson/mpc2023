        text: 'Filling an empty pantry with basic cooking essentials really adds up. Most of us take for granted the many spices and staples we have stocked up in our own cupboards. At The Mary Parrish Center we maintain a community pantry open to all residents with a variety of items such as spices, canned goods, dry goods, non-perishables, etc. Your gift to Stock the Pantry helps keep this pantry full for our residents to stock their kitchen initially and to help with staples throughout their stay. By eliminating food insecurity, our residents are able focus on healing from the trauma of interpersonal violence.'
