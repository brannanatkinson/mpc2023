        text: 'Mobile phones are one of the easiest ways for abusers to continue tracking and harassing their victims. Access to secure mobile phones can be vital to a residentâ€™s personal security. Likewise, computers provide a path to independence. Residents often need computers to apply for jobs or pursue an online education.
