        text: 'Every new resident receives kitchen essentials needed to prepare their favorite meals in their new homes. Each Kitchen Prep Package helps to provide pots, pans, plates, cups, cutlery, oven mitts, mixing bowls and a variety of other essentials. The Mary Parrish Center also encourages our residents to keep these items when they graduate our program into their new, permanent homes.'
