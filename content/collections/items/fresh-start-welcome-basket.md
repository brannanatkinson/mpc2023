        text: 'The Fresh Start Welcome Package will include many necessities possibly overlooked when fleeing violence. This package can be tailored to each new family and might include basic essentials like a toothbrush, toothpaste, bathroom basics, laundry detergent, etc. When a resident moves into The Mary Parrish Center they may be coming from a shelter, a friends home, or even their own car. Most will not have many of these items on hand to begin their new lives.'
