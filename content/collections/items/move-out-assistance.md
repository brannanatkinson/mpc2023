        text: 'Moving out of The Mary Parrish Center is an exciting time for our residents. While they may have arrived here with few belongings, upon their move out they will have created a home for their family. Moving out and starting fresh should not mean starting over. Your Move Out Assistance gift will help offset moving expenses and provide necessities, such as second-hand furniture, so residents can feel comfortable in their new home.'
